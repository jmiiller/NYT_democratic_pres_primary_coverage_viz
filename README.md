# Visualizing the New York Times' Democratic Primary Coverage

A super cool data journalism/visualization project I created (with two amazing teammates) for UBC's CPSC 436V Data Visualization class.

This project attempts to track the New York Times coverage of the Democratic Presidential Primary. It visualizes all NYT articles concerning Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, and Michael Bloomberg. These articles are categorized according a 'sentiment', where each article is assigned a sentiment score according the positive or negative words it uses in speaking of the candidates. These articles are situated in the broader context of the primary. 

We used the NYT's Archive API (https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/archive-product/1/overview) for article data and scraped data from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election) for the key Democratic Primary events.
